p New York City law requires that all owners of residential buildings with 3+ units #[a(href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/owners/compliance-register-your-property.page") register with HPD] (Department of Housing, Preservation, and Development). These registrations are used by HPD to issue violations and track complaints. Although "official" parcel ownership data can be found in a different city database, #[a(href="http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/CP/") ACRIS], the owners listed on HPD registrations are still frequently used by government agencies as a record of ownership. For instance, if a tenant decides to sue their landlord in housing court, the court considers HPD registration to be a valid determination of ownership.
p It is common practice for large property owners and landlords to use an individual LLC or corporation for each building they own (this is not illegal). Accordingly, if one landlord owns 40 buildings, the landlord will typically register each building separately, under the legal entity that owns each individual building. This makes it difficult to know who are the largest property owners.
p Each "corporate owner" registration must include a business address; it's often the address where tenants send their rent to. I have linked together all those addresses that are in common to locate corporations registered to the same address. Although it's technically feasible for multiple businesses to share the same address, it is highly likely that each one of these addresses represents a single corporate entity. Accordingly, in the tables below, you won't find a single "corporation" name.
